        <h1> Hair Donation campaign</h1>
        <h2>Gift Hair Gift Confidence</h2>
        <P>underprivileged women suffering from cancer come from a conservative society. In such a society, having long hair has been regarded as one of the essential features that signifies a woman’s femininity. Hence a common reason why women shy away from cancer treatment is the fear of losing hair or rather the stigma associated with hair loss. In an attempt to address this, the “Gift Hair Gift Confidence”, our signature campaign, is aimed at encouraging underprivileged women, suffering from cancer across the country to step forward and avail treatment. In collaboration with the Adyar Cancer Institute, Chennai and other organizations, the campaign provides an end-to-end solution from conducting hair donation drive to wig distribution. In order to ease the transition of wearing wigs daily, orientation programmes are conducted on wig maintenance and usage, hairstyling techniques for simple hairstyles with wigs for the patients.</P>
        <p>If the patient needs a wig for an extended period, the wigs can be refurbished and made available for the cancer patient at free of cost. We also provide a recipient support number for patients/caregivers to reach out to us for any queries regarding usage and availability of wigs.

        </p>
        <h2>Hair Donation</h2>
        <p>Hair loss is the most apparent physical sign of the battle against cancer. In the case of alopecia there is no known cause or cure. Its impact is more significant in the economically lower strata where long hair is considered an integral part of beauty. With the support of our parent company B & H Exports, we provide wigs of highest quality keeping in mind the needs of the sensitive and delicate skin of the wearer, to restore their confidence to face the world with a smile.</p>

<p>The cost of making a wig is Rs. 7500, of which Rs 2500 (i.e. 1/3 cost of the wig) is sponsored by B & H exports. This sponsorship has played a vital role in considerably reducing the cost of making a wig to Rs. 5,000. Thereby encouraging sponsors to partake in this initiative to provide wigs for marginalized cancer patients.</p>
